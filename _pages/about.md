I'm a fourth-year PhD Candidate at Northwestern University studying macroeconomics. I'm interested in the macro effects of "micro" production at the firm/sector level. Before my PhD, I was a pre-doc at Northwestern University and an [AmeriCorps VISTA](https://indyeast.org/current-americorps-vistas-reflect-on-their-time-with-the-indyeast-promise-zone/) at the IndyEast Promise Zone. I also ran [cross-country and track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg) at the University of Chicago.
