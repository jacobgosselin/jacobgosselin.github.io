I'm a third-year PhD Candidate at Northwestern University studying macroeconomics and industrial organization. I'm interested in the macro effects of "micro" production at the firm/sector level. Before my PhD, I was a pre-doc at Northwestern University and an AmeriCorps VISTA at the IndyEast Promise Zone.
