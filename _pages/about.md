I am a PhD Candidate at Northwestern University studying macroeconomics. I am broadly interested in heterogeneity on the firm side of the macroeconomy. In each of my projects, I aim to combine empirical evidence on how firms differ from one another with tractable models clarifying and quantifying the aggregate implications of such differences. 

Before my PhD, I was a pre-doc at Northwestern University and an [AmeriCorps VISTA](https://indyeast.org/current-americorps-vistas-reflect-on-their-time-with-the-indyeast-promise-zone/) at the IndyEast Promise Zone. I also ran [cross-country and track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eidacczk0gg) at the University of Chicago.
